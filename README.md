# twitter_muter

Twitter stream getting stale? <br>
Want to give a bunch of unkowns in your stream more screen time?<br>
Don't want to make the decision yourself about who to mute? <br>
<br></br>
WELP. Use an auto muter. Like this one.<br>

Mute a bunch of random people for no reason, see how that sits w/ you. <br>
Don't like it? un-mute them later. 
<br><br>
Python 2.7+ / Twython 
<br><br>
Go make an app and get some twitter credentials.

<br><br>
Once you have those, make a folder and save everything to it, make a keys.txt file w/ one cred per line. 
<br><br>
run and rando-mute things!
